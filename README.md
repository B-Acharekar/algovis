# 🧠 AlgoVis – Data Structure Visualizer

**AlgoVis** is a simple and interactive web app that visually demonstrates how key data structures work: **Stack**, **Queue**, and **Linked List**. It helps users understand how operations like `push`, `pop`, `insert`, and `delete` change the structure in real time — with smooth animations.
